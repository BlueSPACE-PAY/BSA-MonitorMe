### ADR 1. Infrustructure Design

## Status: 
Approved

# Context:
StayHealthy, Inc. is expanding into the medical monitoring market and requires a new medical patient monitoring system for hospitals. The system, named MonitorMe, must monitor vital signs using proprietary medical monitoring devices, analyze data in real-time, store historical data, and alert medical professionals of potential issues.

# Decision:
We have decided on the following architecture for the MonitorMe system:

# 1. Data Acquisition Layer:
Utilize custom interfaces or drivers to collect data from proprietary medical monitoring devices.
Ensure compatibility and reliability in data acquisition.

# 2. Data Processing Layer:
Implement real-time analysis of vital signs using algorithms to detect abnormalities.
Consider patient status (awake/asleep) for appropriate analysis and alerting.

# 3. Data Storage Layer:
Store both raw and processed data securely in a scalable database system.
Implement data partitioning strategies for efficient retrieval.

# 4. Alerting and Notification System:
Develop a notification system to alert medical professionals of potential issues. Push notifications to StayHealthy mobile app on smartphones. Display alerts on the consolidated monitoring screen in each nurse's station.

# 5. User Interface Layer:
Design intuitive user interfaces for medical professionals to interact with the system. Provide a consolidated monitoring screen at each nurse's station displaying vital signs of patients. Include features for filtering and viewing historical data.

# 6. Security Layer:
Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure patient data privacy. Encrypt data transmission and storage to prevent unauthorized access.

# 7. Scalability and Performance:
Design the system to handle a large number of patients and monitoring devices. Utilize scalable cloud infrastructure for flexibility and growth. Optimize performance to meet the requirement of 1-second response time for data consolidation.

# 8. Integration Layer:
Integrate with existing systems such as MyMedicalData for seamless data exchange. Ensure interoperability with other healthcare IT systems used in hospitals.

# 9. Monitoring and Logging:
Implement monitoring tools to track system health and performance. Log important events and errors for troubleshooting and auditing purposes.

# 10. Compliance and Testing:
Conduct thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Ensure compliance with medical device regulations and standards.

# Consequences:
This architecture provides a solid foundation for building the MonitorMe system, meeting the requirements outlined by StayHealthy, Inc. It ensures scalability, reliability, security, and compliance with healthcare regulations. However, it will require careful implementation and ongoing maintenance to ensure successful deployment and operation.
