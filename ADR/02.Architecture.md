### ADR 2. Architectural Design

## Status: 
Approved

### Context
StayHealthy, Inc. is expanding into the medical monitoring market and requires a new medical patient monitor system. The goal is to enhance patient care, improve response times, and provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals. The proposed system architecture aligns with StayHealthyâ€™s existing SAAS products: MonitorThem and MyMedicalData.

### Decision
For a healthcare system dealing with real-time data and requiring scalability, reliability, and performance, a microservices architecture would be well-suited.

### Consequences

### Pros
1. *** Scalability:** Microservices architecture allows for independent scaling of services based on demand. This is particularly advantageous in healthcare where different services might experience varying levels of load (e.g., patient management, appointment scheduling, real-time monitoring).

2. *** Flexibility and Agility:** Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and updated independently, enabling faster iteration and innovation. This agility is crucial in healthcare systems where requirements evolve rapidly, and new features need to be implemented quickly to adapt to changing patient needs or regulatory requirements.

3. *** Modularity and Maintainability:** Microservices promote modularity by breaking down the system into smaller, more manageable components. This enhances code reusability, simplifies testing, and facilitates continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) practices, making it easier to maintain and evolve the software over time.

4. *** Technology Diversity:** Microservices architecture allows for technology diversity within the system. Each microservice can be implemented using the most suitable technology stack for its specific requirements. This flexibility enables teams to choose the best tools for each job, optimizing performance and efficiency.

5. *** Decentralized Data Management:** In a microservices architecture, each microservice typically manages its own data store. This decentralization of data management can improve performance by reducing contention and latency in accessing shared databases. It also enhances data privacy and security by limiting access to sensitive information only to the microservices that need it.

### Cons

1. *** Complexity** Microservices introduce additional complexity compared to monolithic architectures. Managing a distributed system with multiple services, inter-service communication, and orchestration can be challenging. Additionally, ensuring consistency, resilience, and observability across microservices requires sophisticated monitoring and management tools.

2. *** Inter-Service Communication Overhead:** Communication between microservices introduces overhead, especially in distributed environments. Remote procedure calls (RPC), RESTful APIs, or message queues are commonly used for inter-service communication, which can introduce latency and complexity.

3. *** Deployment and DevOps Overhead:** Deploying and managing multiple microservices requires robust DevOps practices and infrastructure automation. This includes containerization (e.g., Docker), orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), service discovery, configuration management, and continuous deployment pipelines. Setting up and maintaining this infrastructure can be resource-intensive.

4. *** Data Consistency and Transactions:** Maintaining data consistency across multiple microservices can be challenging, especially in distributed transactions. Ensuring data integrity, ACID compliance, and handling eventual consistency requires careful design and coordination, potentially leading to additional complexity.

5. *** Operational Complexity:** Operating a microservices-based healthcare system requires expertise in distributed systems, monitoring, troubleshooting, and performance optimization. Managing service dependencies, versioning, and backward compatibility adds to the operational complexity, requiring skilled engineers and dedicated resources.
