### Context
StayHealthy, Inc. is expanding into the medical monitoring market and requires a new medical patient monitor system. The goal is to enhance patient care, improve response times, and provide actionable insights for healthcare professionals. The proposed system architecture aligns with StayHealthy’s existing SAAS products: MonitorThem and MyMedicalData.

### Decision
We recommend the following architecture for the StayHealthy Medical Patient Monitor System:

*** Microservices Architecture :**
The system will be built using microservices to ensure scalability, modularity, and independent development.
Each microservice will focus on specific functionality, such as user account management, patient monitoring, data analytics, and MyMedicalData integration.

*** Event-Driven Architecture (EDA):**
The system will follow an EDA approach to handle real-time events related to patient conditions.
Events (e.g., heart rate spikes, low oxygen levels) will be published by the patient monitoring microservice and consumed by healthcare professionals, hospitals, and emergency responders.

*** Bounded Contexts:**
We’ll break down the system into bounded contexts (BCs) to ensure clear boundaries and separation of concerns.
Each BC represents a cohesive part of the system, such as user management or patient monitoring.
*** Hexagonal Architecture:**
Within each bounded context, we recommend implementing the hexagonal architecture.
This approach separates domain logic from infrastructure concerns, promoting maintainability and testability.

### Rationale

*** Microservices:** Microservices allow us to scale individual components independently, facilitate continuous deployment, and promote modular development. They align with StayHealthy’s existing SAAS products.

*** EDA:** An event-driven approach ensures real-time responsiveness, allowing healthcare professionals to receive critical alerts promptly.
Bounded Contexts: Clear boundaries between contexts prevent accidental coupling and maintain system integrity.

*** Hexagonal Architecture:** Separation of concerns simplifies testing, promotes clean code, and ensures flexibility.

# Consequences
1. *** Scalability:** Microservices enable horizontal scaling, but coordination between services may introduce complexity.

2. *** Operational Overhead:** Managing multiple microservices requires robust deployment and monitoring practices.

3. *** Learning Curve:** Developers need to understand EDA and hexagonal architecture principles.
