### ADR 4. Data Streamer

## Status
Approved

## Context
MonitorMe reads data from eight different patient-monitoring equipment vital sign input sources MonitorMe must record and store the past 24 hours of all vital sign readings. A medical professional can review this history, filtering on time range as well as vital sign.

## Decision
Using PostgreSQL to store the healthcare data.

## Consequences
 
### Positive

*** Reliability and Durability:** PostgreSQL is known for its reliability and durability. It ensures data integrity through features like ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, making it suitable for storing critical healthcare data.

*** Advanced Features:** PostgreSQL offers a wide range of advanced features such as JSON support, full-text search, geospatial data support, and window functions. These features can be beneficial for handling various types of healthcare data and performing complex queries.

*** Scalability:** While not as inherently scalable as some NoSQL databases, PostgreSQL can scale horizontally with techniques like sharding and replication. It can handle sizable datasets and growing workloads with proper configuration and optimization.

*** Mature Ecosystem:** PostgreSQL has a mature ecosystem with extensive documentation, community support, and a large number of third-party tools and libraries. This makes it easier to find resources and solutions when developing healthcare applications.

*** Security:** PostgreSQL provides robust security features including SSL support, role-based access control (RBAC), and data encryption capabilities. This is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive healthcare data, especially in compliance with regulations like HIPAA.


### Negative

*** Scalability Limitations:** While PostgreSQL can scale horizontally to some extent, it may not be as inherently scalable as some NoSQL databases designed for distributed architectures. Managing scalability in PostgreSQL requires careful planning and may involve more operational overhead.

*** Complexity:** PostgreSQL can be complex to set up and administer, especially for users unfamiliar with relational database management systems. Managing indexes, optimizing queries, and ensuring performance require expertise and ongoing maintenance.

*** Performance:** While PostgreSQL is generally performant, it may not offer the same level of performance for certain use cases as specialized databases optimized for specific workloads (e.g., analytics, time-series data). Tuning PostgreSQL for optimal performance may require significant effort.

*** Cost:** While PostgreSQL itself is open-source and free to use, there may be associated costs for deployment, maintenance, and support, especially in enterprise environments requiring high availability and specialized expertise.

*** Schema Evolution Challenges:** Altering the schema in PostgreSQL can be challenging, especially in production environments with large datasets and complex dependencies. Schema changes may require downtime or careful planning to minimize disruption.
