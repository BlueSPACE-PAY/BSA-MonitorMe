### ADR 3. WebApp UI

## Status
Approved

## Context
Medical professionals receive alert push notifications of a potential problem based on raw data analysis to a StayHeathy mobile app on their smart phone.

## Decision
The user interface (UI) of a healthcare application should prioritize usability, accessibility, and efficiency to ensure that medical officers can effectively interact with the software while focusing on patient care. .

## Consequences

## Pros
1. *** Usability:** A well-designed UI improves usability, making it easier for medical officers to navigate the application, access information, and perform tasks efficiently. This can lead to increased productivity and reduced errors in patient care.

2. *** Accessibility:** An accessible UI ensures that medical officers with disabilities can effectively use the application, providing equal access to healthcare information and services for all users.

3. *** Enhanced User Experience:** A user-friendly UI enhances the overall user experience, leading to higher user satisfaction and engagement with the application. This can foster positive relationships between medical officers and the software, encouraging its adoption and continued use.

4. *** Efficiency:** A streamlined UI design reduces cognitive load and minimizes the time and effort required for medical officers to complete tasks. This improves workflow efficiency and allows medical officers to focus more on patient care rather than struggling with cumbersome software interfaces.

5. *** Visual Representation of Data:** An intuitive UI can present complex healthcare data in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand format, facilitating data analysis, decision-making, and patient monitoring. Visualizations such as charts, graphs, and dashboards can help medical officers identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in patient data more effectively.

### Cons

1. *** Learning Curve:** A complex or unfamiliar UI design may have a steep learning curve for medical officers, especially those who are not tech-savvy or have limited experience with digital tools. This can lead to frustration and resistance to adoption.

2. *** Overwhelming Information:** An overloaded UI with excessive information, features, or options can overwhelm medical officers, making it difficult to find relevant information or perform tasks efficiently. This may result in information overload and reduced productivity.

3. *** Inconsistency:** Inconsistent UI design elements, such as varying layouts, colors, or terminology, can confuse medical officers and disrupt their workflow. Consistency is crucial for building familiarity and usability within the application.

4. *** Technical Constraints:** Technical limitations, such as performance issues, compatibility issues with different devices or browsers, or integration challenges with other systems, can hinder the effectiveness of the UI and compromise user experience.

5. *** Security Risks:** Poorly designed UI elements, such as inadequate authentication mechanisms, weak password policies, or lack of encryption, can pose security risks and expose sensitive patient data to unauthorized access or breaches.
